## Title
Build a Recommendation System using SingleStore's Vector Search

## Abstract
Discover the power of SingleStore's vector search technology in building advanced recommendation systems. This workshop will guide you through using SingleStore's capabilities to create a movie recommendation engine. Attendees will learn essential techniques to harness the potential of vector search for personalised recommendations. In this workshop, participants will:

1. Understand the fundamentals of vector search and its application in recommendation systems.
2. Learn how to use SingleStore with vector embeddings.
3. Implement vector search queries to find similar items based on user preferences.
4. Optimise and scale the recommendation system for real-world applications.

No prior experience with SingleStore is required. A basic understanding of SQL and Python will be helpful, but is not essential. Join us to unlock the potential of SingleStore in creating a cutting-edge movie recommendation system.
